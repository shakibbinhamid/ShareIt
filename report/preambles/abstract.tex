The smartphone application industry is diverse and competitive. Emerging technologies and ever-changing user expectations turn the rigid classic engineering principles on its head. On the other hand, modern software engineering practices such as scrum, regular testing, participatory design and user experience evaluation hope to overcome the various challenges that developers usually face in the paradigm. This project demonstrates the application of such processes by developing a hybrid mobile application for University of Southampton students to benefit from Collaborative Consumption.
