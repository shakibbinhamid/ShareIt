## Share It : A hybrid mobile app for collaborative consumption

### Origin
This is my 3rd year Individual Project as a Software Engineering student in Univerity of Southampton.

### Parts
The project is divided into 2 distinct parts - 
  1. The **_Client_** Side, in ```client/```, written in Ionic framework. It is a mobile development framework in HTML, CSS and AngularJS.
  2. The **_Server_** Side, in ```server/```, written in NodeJS.

### Details of Project
The ```report/``` folder has a very detailed (89 page) report on the entire project, including -
 1. test results,
 2. project success, 
 3. methodology and 
 4. future work.

**NOTE** : The project was written in Ionic 1 and AngularJS 1.4. Specific versions of the libraries are found in the report. The project
most likely will NOT build without the exact versions of Ionic. Use the code and the report together to get inspiration for you REST API
project or mobile applications.
